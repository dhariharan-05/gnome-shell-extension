GNOME Extensions-Mount Meter

Easily monitor and manage your mounted removable drives, displaying sizes and highlighting the mount with the least used space in the top bar.

Forked and Modified extensively from Removable Drive Menu by fmuellner.

Note:- 
1.The list will automatically refresh every 5 seconds to provide updated information.
2.Any ongoing event(e.g. a file transfer) which result in changes(% used) in mount sizes will trigger the top bar indicator to highlight/flash until the file operation completes,this is intended and also partially doubles up as a file transfer operation indicator :)
